An addition to the Angelos Karageorgiou's vgagreek (http://unix.gr/) DOS greek keyboard driver. 

The additions/modifications enable DOS programs to 

* support the ELOT-928 (iso-8859-7) character set. 
* includes support for accented capitals, accented with diaeresis, and the middle dot (ano telia)! 

This set includes a keyboard driver (TSR, x86 assembly) and vga fonts.
